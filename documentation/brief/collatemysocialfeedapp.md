# Collate My Social Feed App

**Challenge Rating: 3/5**

Utilising Cordova and Ionic, you will develop a cross-platform mobile app that will gather and organise posts from various social media streams and platforms into a single feed.

The app will be able to be given a configuration of `platform: username(s)` key value pairs before gathering, organising and displaying posts.

The app should be able to gather posts from at least 2 social media platforms, eg:
- Twitter Tweets
- Instagram Images
- Facebook Posts
- (other social media)

The configuration will need be changable using some user-interface in the app. Allowing users to add/remove accounts/platforms before refreshing the feed.

Points to note:
* Each platform will require you to authenticate your app and user. Make sure you KNOW (have evidence) early on that your app will have access to the data you will need.
* Each platform feed should have some commonality: a good place to start would be to limit all posts to a platform name, title, text and image urls. This way you can reuse the UI functionality for every platform.
* Communications with each platform will be different. You will need to utilise a plug-in architecture, so you can work on comunications independently of the mainapp, or UI.
